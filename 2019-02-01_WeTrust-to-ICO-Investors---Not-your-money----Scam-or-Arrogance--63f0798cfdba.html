This is lopsided as hell (even worse than premined alt coins in my eyes).The token TRST is not fuel, since it is not ever consumed, so there is no reason why it should ever go up in price or value. Even if it turns out that many people use TRST, the value wouldn&#39;t increase since it is infinitely reusable. Using the term &quot;fuel&quot; to describe the token is incredibly misleading, and whoever designed and named the system either knows or should have known that a proper term would be more aligned with &quot;stake&quot;.Adding up these two factors make it seem like this is a literal donation, not an investment.</blockquote><blockquote name="5310" id="5310" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Why should I buy into the crowd fund?

Happy to elaborate more on the below if more questions arise.<br><br>To all the Token questions: Tokens are the representation of the fees generated on the platform and these tokens are bartered around. They aren&#39;t destroyed, rather just pass from individuals who provide Trust to individuals who require Trust. For example, Forepersons can charge fees in the form of Trustcoin for their services as a Trusted Lending Circle organizer. Trust Lending Circle participants will need to pay for the services of a Foreperson in Trustcoins. Those who lack reputation may need a close associate to vouch and serve as loan guarantor - and pay a fee for this service in the form of Trustcoin. As we open up the platform to allow ourselves and others to build out additional products such as Credit Identities, Direct Lending, and Mutual insurance, any fees on the platform will also be represented by TRST tokens.<br><br>In Ethereum, Miners provide value and receive Ether. (similar to Forepersons) Users of the platform who want to deploy contracts, call on the network, etc. pay Ether. (Trusted Lending Circle participants) In this manner, Ethereum is similar to our WeTrust Platform.</blockquote><p name="06b6" id="06b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">He did not mention anything about WeTrust taking all the fees from the platform, in addition to keeping 10m tokens (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trust/" data-href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trust/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out of a total of 100m</a>) to their team (locked for 2 years).

The only caveat — ETH is already integrated. Due to the way the team is handling their project’s token and not doing anything to make it valuable or liquid, that’s a horrible suggestion — your money is at huge risk: it is more volatile that ETH and the low volume makes it difficult to buy or sell at the market price. So there is no actual use case for the token until this day.</p><h3 name="63aa" id="63aa" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">WeTrust Lawsuit</h3><p name="c1f3" id="c1f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Around ICO time a dispute has occurred between the founding members — Ron Merom v WeTrust Inc. Nothing is known about the details. Not the reasons, not the process, not who is paying for it. The team has mentioned financial difficulties in 2018 and listed the lawsuit as one of such difficulties.</p><h3 name="6a91" id="6a91" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion</h3><p name="a1da" id="a1da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">WeTrust is on a mission. It’s what they always say. It’s always something along the lines of “Thanks for supporting our mission” or “we are on a mission for social good”. Financial inclusion is their most used phrase. Indeed, the team seems to be on a mission to financially include themselves in the top 0.01% with the amount of money they should have from the ICO.</p><h3 name="5364" id="5364" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">TL;DR:</h3><ul class="postList"><li name="155e" id="155e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3">WeTrust held an ICO, raised $5m. They were talking about the size of the ROSCA <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">(also known as TLC)</em> market and how much potential there is. People raised concerns about WeTrust having the cake and eating it.</li><li name="66bb" id="66bb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The team says they have “financial difficulties”. <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">At the peak of the price of Ethereum in 2017–2018, their stash would be worth $215m. </strong>They should have at least $15m because the price of Ethereum is triple of the ICO, and that’s a lowball figure.</li><li name="b440" id="b440" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The team kept 10% of the tokens to themselves (with a 2 year vest). In addition to that they plan to keep all the profits from the platform from the fees.</li><li name="01c3" id="01c3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The team refuses exchange listings, and is getting delisted (Bittrex). The community is not happy about this.</li><li name="9724" id="9724" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Obviously the price of the token is very low. There’s no usecase for it even though it’s been almost 2 years since the ICO.</li><li name="08ca" id="08ca" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The team now says the token is not an investment. And shouldn’t be used for speculation. As for questions about why people funded their ICO, they “do not know the true intentions behind every person”.</li><li name="6fd4" id="6fd4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Of course, since it’s not an investment in the team’s eyes, the people that contributed to their token are not investors/shareholders, but donators, contributors, etc. Involuntarily, of course. Granted, if this was a kickstarter page instead of an ICO it would not gain any traction.</li><li name="f45b" id="f45b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The TRST token at the peak was $1.25. It is now barely $0.008. 156x less! The team claims it’s because of the “cryptocurrency decline” and not their actions. Even now the price is 10 times less than the ICO price.</li><li name="c100" id="c100" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Apparently there are some legal issues with SEC in regards of TRST being a security. Perhaps that is why the team says it’s not an investment. It is not known what the team is doing to mitigate this problem.</li></ul><p name="6685" id="6685" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Thanks to “you” (literally the username is you) from the <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/F0J7uxYM8w3KC04sVMq_gg" data-href="https://t.me/joinchat/F0J7uxYM8w3KC04sVMq_gg" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WeTrust Investors group</a> for compiling a short summary of the situation, and every community member that has raised questions, specifically the uncomfortable ones, in the past, allowing us to see the true nature of the team.

I want this piece of information to be as accurate as possible.</p><p name="044b" id="044b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">We encourage the WeTrust team to be more open, honest, cut the corporate speak and approach the issue head-on.

The coin will be essential for our trusted lending circles (aka, ROSCAs) to function (as all fees will be quoted in terms of Trustcoin). Future features that will be developed out from the trusted lending circles will also require Trustcoins as their &quot;fuel&quot;/ collateral. Does this help? Let me know if you have any questions - we&#39;re currently working on a nicely written blog post that goes into high detail about our coin to help the general audience.<br><br>Q: What profit sources exist for the TRST token holders?<br>Under advice from our lawyers, I cannot comment on how TRST tokens are a &quot;profit source&quot;. That is for you to decide. However, I can provide you a piece I wrote on &quot;crowdsale analysis&quot;.

Why would I, a person who bought TRST to use it on the WeTrust platform care about it? Why did he post his piece on investment into ICOs? What place did it have there? Why was there no limit or warning for people buying a lot of these tokens? — it’s too much for fees.</p><p name="f6f5" id="f6f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m sure if you dig deeper you will find more occurrences of this.</p><p name="ea90" id="ea90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Until this day TRST token has no utility</strong>. Do not be fooled by sentences like “It can be used in TLC” — yes, it can. But why would anyone do that? They can also use ETH, a much more stable cryptocurrency, which doesn’t have liquidity issues like TRST (Daily volume: $200), and is on virtually every cryptocurrency exchange out there. Why would you say this to us, the community? It’s an easy way out of the argument and it might just work for some people who don’t know much about the project or are not interested in the technical details (perhaps they bought it as an “investment”), but for the people that do know the details it just further distances the team from them.</p><h3 name="6da3" id="6da3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What is TRST?

At best you could say they funded a usecase for the TRST token, which you still did not deliver. I only hope that you sometimes doubt and wonder “are we doing the right thing?”. People have told you this many times, I’m sure. If you are afraid of trouble from SEC, why are you not afraid of people writing complaints to them? Do you think you are right, and using an ICO to fund your project was the right thing to do? Again, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">do you not know the true reason why people bought your token</strong>? Patrick, you yourself are one of these people — you wrote an article about investing into ICOs for “handsome profit”. If the tables turned around and all of the TRST token holders were the WeTrust team and you were the investor, would you now be happy about the situation?</p></div></div></section>

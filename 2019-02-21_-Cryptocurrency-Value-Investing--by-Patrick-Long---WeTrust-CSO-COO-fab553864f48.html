As opposed to ‘The ICO Flip’ which focuses on short term arbitrage with a short investment timeline, ‘Value Investing’ focuses on long term developments of a project and identifies undervalued and under hyped projects. My strategy uses various metrics such as: management team analysis, overhyped versus under hyped, timeline and release milestones, exchange adoption, and comparative analysis. In the following paragraphs, we will examine each in more detail: <br><br>Management team, community and future team growth. A crypto-currency’s team and community is essential for their success. When I’m looking for a crypto-currency to invest in, I do my due diligence to verify that the team has strong programmers, marketers, designers, and a supportive community that is intelligent, proactive, and active. As a proxy to gauge the competency of the team, I examine how the team writes their code, publishes their announcements, designs their website, and engages with their community. Since most crypto-currency projects pride themselves on transparency, their source code is open source and published regularly on Github. It is important then for a savvy investor to examine the code and documentation to gauge how the code is written and if the code is up on par with industry standards. Personally, I like to look for proper documentation explaining the code functionality, frequent code pushes, and community involvement in finding and fixing code issues. <br><br>Hype analysis. Despite having a strong management team, marketing and creating hype for a project is important for investors. It is also important to gauge whether or not the project is under-hyped or over-hyped. What is the public sentiment currently? Is the price overly depressed due to factors that are not permanent and may reverse in the near future? I believe it is important to identify what stage of the hype cycle your investment is in and make investment decisions accordingly. As a rule of thumb, a savvy investor should sell in a period of hype and buy in a period of under hype. <br><br>Timeline and release milestones. Timing and key release milestones will help an investor craft their investment timeline and strategy. I have seen many inexperienced investors complain about their coin’s valuation at a particular point in time in which many key release milestones have yet to be met. The coin may be in a period of under hype and lots of key features promised may be delayed or not yet released. Given this unfavorable environment, as a savvy investor, we would expect the coin to be oversold and undervalued. However, if we believe given our analysis of the capabilities and honesty of the management team and community that the coin will be able to successfully release their key features and meet their timeline, this coin could present a good buying opportunity for an investment in the near term. We make a plan and provided certain triggering events occur (release of a key product, major press release, mainstream media penetration, large brand name partnership) and favorable price movement, we exit our investment. As savvy investors, we are patient and look for opportunities to invest where the market is overly pessimistic about a project meeting it’s release milestone. We then create a plan to exit once certain trigger events are met, hopefully for a handsome profit! <br>Exchange adoption. Exchange adoption is crucial for a seamless investment exit because it provides the necessary liquidity for our trade. Lots of novice investors do not realize that the crypto-currency markets are significantly different compared to regular securities traded on large exchanges like the NYSE. Crypto-currencies are an extremely small market and exchanges that support these small projects may not have sufficient volume to generate enough buy orders for large stake holders to unload their position without make a significant impact on its price and overall valuation. Hence, it is important to take price without volume with a grain of salt. A savvy investor needs to determine the probability that his coin will be able to be listed onto a major Bitcoin/Altcoin exchange, so that it will have the volume to support large sell orders and allow large stakeholders to exit their positions successfully without crashing the coin’s valuation.<br><br>Comparative analysis. Comparative analysis is a tool I borrowed from the traditional markets where savvy investors compare the valuations of two similar themed companies and evaluate the differences between the two. If you identify a viable competitor of industry giant and view that the underdog could potentially pose a significant threat to the incumbent’s position, we may have an investment opportunity. Consider Lisk (LSK), a new crypto-currency created a few months ago whose mission was to develop a decentralized platform for decentralized applications programmed specifically on JavaScript (the world’s most popular programming language). Lisk was advertised as an Ethereum competitor whose product offering (a decentralized application platform) had a supposed larger developer audience. At the end of it’s Initial Coin Offering (ICO), it had a valuation of roughly $7,000,000 USD compared to Ethereum’s valuation of over $1,000,000,000 USD. A savvy investor would be able to identify this investment opportunity based on comparative analysis. Lisk is a competing decentralized application platform with a much lower valuation compared to Ethereum and could easily capture additional investors and support for its platform if there were any problems with the incumbent. Furthermore, it advertised a more user friendly programming language and easy to use interface. Ultimately, the Lisk ICO was a huge success for ICO investors. Investors who participated in the ICO bought the coin $0.07 and at its high point, Lisk traded for $0.49 or roughly a 700% profit within a period of a few months. At the time of this writing, Lisk is trading at $0.30 which is still a huge success.</blockquote></div></div></section><section name="bd47" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="3cc4" id="3cc4" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Considering Patrick, one of the WeTrust co-founders himself, invests into ICO for “handsome profit”, and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">still</strong> hearing sentences like this:</p><figure name="9423" id="9423" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 557px; max-height: 362px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 65%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Fb16nlDNOQzn_hMXnK71ug.png" data-width="557" data-height="362" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Fb16nlDNOQzn_hMXnK71ug.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">20 FEB 2019.
